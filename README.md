### Hi, I'm Catharine! ðŸ‘‹

I love helping create inclusive experiences for everyone. I'm excited to bring this to GitHub as the Sr. Program Manager for Accessibility. I'm a bilateral cochlear implant user. 

When I'm not working, you can find me: 
* :golf: being active through golf, tennis, pickleball, snow skiing, trail running, Peloton, or CrossFit,
* :hammer: figuring out my DIY project(s). I'm either on YouTube teaching myself or in my evening woodworking class, 
* :watch: experimenting with tech to create more accessible uses, like setting up my home to flash my lights or alert my watch via sound triggers,  
* :ear: serving on the [Alexander Graham Bell Association Board of Directors](http://www.agbell.org "Alexander Graham Bell Association Board of Directors") and/or preparing/leading their summer teen leadership programs
