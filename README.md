### Hi, I'm Catharine! ðŸ‘‹

I love helping create inclusive experiences for everyone. I'm excited to bring this to GitHub as the Sr. Program Manager for Accessibility. I'm a bilateral cochlear implant user. 

When I'm not working, you can find me: 
* :golf: being active through golf, tennis, pickleball, snow skiing, trail running, Peloton, or CrossFit,
* :hammer: figuring out my DIY project(s). I'm either on YouTube teaching myself or in my evening woodworking class, 
* :watch: experimenting with tech to create more accessible uses, like setting up my home to flash my lights or alert my watch via sound triggers,  
* :ear: serving on the [Alexander Graham Bell Association Board of Directors](http://www.agbell.org "Alexander Graham Bell Association Board of Directors") and/or preparing/leading their summer teen leadership programs

### GitHub Actions for Project Board Management

We have introduced new GitHub actions to our repository to automate the management of issue status labels and ensure timely updates and notifications. These actions are designed to:

- **Update Status Labels**: Automatically updates the status labels of issues at specified frequencies:
  - One status label is updated once a year.
  - The second status label is updated twice a year.
  - The third status label is updated every quarter.
  
- **Notify Assignees**: Sends notifications to the assignee and @cmcnally when an issue's status label is marked as "not started".

#### Viewing Label Changes

To view the changes in status labels, you can check the insights tab for a graph of label updates over time. Alternatively, for a more interactive view, you can use a mermaid.js view within a discussion post. Instructions on setting up and viewing these graphs are available in our repository's wiki.
